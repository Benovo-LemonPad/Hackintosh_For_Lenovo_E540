# Mac OS Monterey Hackintosh for Lenovo E540.
I decided to make a Hackintosh using OpenCore instead of Clover. This way YOU don't have to go through the trouble of having a kernel panic a billion times.

# What works.
* Trackpad ✔
* Wi-Fi ✔
* Audio ✔
* Camera ✔
* USB ✔

# What doesn't work.
* ALS (Ambiant Light Sensor) ❌
* Bluetooth ❌
* Sleep Mode ❌
* You tell me the rest.
