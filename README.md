# Mac OS Monterey Hackintosh for Lenovo E540.
I decided to make a Hackintosh using OpenCore instead of Clover. A lot of the other ones on Github used outdated versions of Mac OS while, this one uses the latest version of Mac OS supported by this processor.

# What works.
* Trackpad ✔
* Wi-Fi ✔
* Audio ✔
* Camera ✔
* USB ✔

# What doesn't work.
* ALS (Ambiant Light Sensor) ❌
* Bluetooth ❌
* Sleep Mode ❌
* You tell me the rest.

# Preparation.
## You need.
* (Atleast) 4 GB USB.
* Computer running Windows, Mac OS or Linux.

# Installation.
(NOTE) If you have a 32 GB USB or lower, continue with "Formating USBs with smaller storage sizes." If you have a USB with 64 GB or higher scroll down to "Formating USBs with larger storage sizes."

## Formating USBs with smaller storage sizes.
* Windows

1.) Open File Explorer and plug in your USB.

2.) Right click on your USB drive and click format.

3.) Make sure your USB filesystem is FAT32, the name is EFI (case sensitive) and click on Start. (NOTE) This will erase all data from the USB!

* Mac OS/Linux

  Sorry, there is no tutorial for Mac OS and Linux.
